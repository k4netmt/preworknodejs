##Features

###Echo Server:
```bash
>curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8000 -d "hello word" -H "foo:bar"
* Rebuilt URL to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 8000 (#0)
> POST / HTTP/1.1
> Host: 127.0.0.1:8000
> User-Agent: curl/7.46.0
> Accept: */*
> foo:bar
> Content-Length: 10
> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
>
* upload completely sent off: 10 out of 10 bytes
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< host: 127.0.0.1:8000
< user-agent: curl/7.46.0
< accept: */*
< foo: bar
< content-length: 10
< content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
< Date: Sat, 01 Oct 2016 04:42:56 GMT

hello word* Connection #0 to host 127.0.0.1 left intact
```

### Proxy Server:
curl -v http://127.0.0.1:9000 -d "hello word" -H "foo:bar"
Port 9000 will proxy to the echo server on port 8000.
```bash
* Rebuilt URL to: http://127.0.0.1:9000/
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 9000 (#0)
> POST / HTTP/1.1
> Host: 127.0.0.1:9000
> User-Agent: curl/7.46.0
> Accept: */*
> foo:bar
> Content-Length: 10
> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
>
* upload completely sent off: 10 out of 10 bytes
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< host: 127.0.0.1:8000
< user-agent: curl/7.46.0
